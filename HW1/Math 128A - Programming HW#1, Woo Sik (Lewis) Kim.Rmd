The programs were written in Python.

To run the code for Q1, run ``find_extrema(a, b, c, d, e, f)``. ``test_q1()`` provides solutions to the given test cases. The polynomials were graphed using Desmos.

To run the code for Q2, run ``nested_radicals(n)``, where ``n`` is the $n$th term of the sequence. ``test_q2()`` provides solutions to the first $40$ terms of the sequence. The code for the graph in Q2 is in ``q2plot.py``. 

**Question 1**

The algorithm for question 1 is straightforward; given 6 numbers, $a, b, c, d, e,$ and $f$, we find the coefficients to the first derivative (a quadratic) of the cubic in the form $f(x) = cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f$. Using these coefficients, we find the solution to $f'(x) = 0$ through the quadratic formula. If the roots are imaginary, it means there are no turning points in the cubic, and we are done (min/max depend only on $a, b$ and evaluations $f(a), f(b)$). Otherwise, we have 2 solutions, $x_1$ and $x_2$. We plug these 2 values into the second derivative $f''(x)$ (determined by the coefficients $6c$ and $2d$) to see if $x_1, x_2$ are $< 0, = 0,$ or $> 0$. Less than $0$ implies local max, greater than $0$ implies local min, and equal to $0$ implies saddle point.

After determining which of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are local minimums and maximums, we check if either or both of $x_1$ and $x_2$ lie in $[a, b]$, and determine the local min/max from there (e.g. if both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $[a, b]$, then the local extrema occur at these 2 points. If neither are in it, then the local extrema depend on evaluations of $f(a), f(b)$ (smaller is min, bigger is max)). A more detailed breakdown of these cases are in ``hw1.py``. 

The edge cases for this algorithm are when $c$ and/or $d$ and/or $e$ are $0$. If $c = 0$ and $d, e$ are not, then we simply have a quadratic, and we run an algorithm for finding the extrema for a quadratic by calculating the vertex $h = \frac{-b}{2a}$ and the concavity of the parabola.

If $c, d = 0$, then we have a simple line, in which case the local min/max depends entirely on whether or not the slope is positive or negative.

**Question 2**

The algorithm for question 2 is an iterative evaluation (iterating backwards from $n$). We reassign a value ``nested_sum`` to an inner square root each step, i.e.:

```python
nested_sum = 1
for k in range(1, n, -1):
  nested_sum = math.sqrt(1 + k*nested_sum)
```

We evaluate $a_n$ for $1 \le n \le 40$:

$a_1 = 1$

$a_2 = 1.7320508075688772$

$a_3 = 2.23606797749979$

$a_4 = 2.559830165300118$

$a_5 = 2.755053261329896$

...

$a_{38} = 2.9999999999454037$

$a_{39} = 2.9999999999725286$

$a_{40} = 2.99999999998618$

From the first $40$ terms of the sequence $a_n$, it appears that $\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 3$.

_Graph of $\ln(|a_n - a|)$ vs. $n$ and $y = 3 - (\ln(3))n$ is on the next page._

![Green: Graph of $\ln(|a_n - a|)$ vs. $n$. Blue: $y = 3 - (\ln(3))n$.](q2)

From the graph, it appears that $\beta_n = 3 - (\ln(3))n$, i.e. $\beta_n = y$ is appropriate for the upper bound $O(\beta_n) = a_n - a$.

We can verify this by representing $\ln(|a_n - a|)$ as a continuous function $f$, letting $g(x) = 3 - (\ln(3))x$, and calculating $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$. Doing so gives us a limit of $0$, which, by asymptotic analysis, shows that $f = O(g)$.
